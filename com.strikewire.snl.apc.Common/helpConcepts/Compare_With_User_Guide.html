<h1>Instructions on using the <b>Compare Current Editor With...</b> (diff) utility</h1>
<p>
In the "Select a file to compare" window, a list of active tabs is shown.  Tabs that cannot be compared with are not listed.  You may select one of the active tabs to compare, or press the "Choose external file" button to bring up a file dialog and select a file from the file system to compare the current editor with.
</p>
<br/>Be sure to save any changes to the current editor before comparing.  The compare editor will either replace a currently open compare editor or open in a new tab.  See <i>Window->Preferences->General->Compare/Patch->Compare (Diff)</i> to update these preferences.
