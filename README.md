This is the *Next Generation Workflow* project. The system includes an Eclipse-based workflow editor and a portable Java runtime system. The runtime is designed to be implementable on a variety of Java workflow engines. The initial implementation is based on Google Sarasvati.

These plugins are intended to be used with Eclipse Oxygen R2. Use the Target-Platform to generate your target platform for PDE development.
