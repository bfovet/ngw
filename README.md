This is the *Next Generation Workflow* project. The full system includes an Eclipse-based workflow editor and a portable Java runtime system. The runtime is designed to be implementable on a variety of Java workflow engines. The initial implementation is based on Google Sarasvati.

Note

The initial commit is just the core runtime system. The editor will be added to this repository soon.
