      <div>
         
         <h2>Description</h2>
         
         <p>A multipurpose node for basic file operations. Can read a file's contents, write data to a file, or simply represent a path to a file. </p>
         
         </div>
      
      
      <div>
         
         <h2>Properties</h2>
         
         <p>fileName - the name or path of a file. If a filename or relative pathname is given, the interpretation depends on whether or not data is to be written to the file.
         If there is no data to write to the file, the path is interpreted relative to the workflow home directory; if there is data is to write to the file, the path is
         interpreted relative to the file node's work directory.</p>
         
         <p>append - if this boolean property is 'true', then if used to write to a file, this node will append data to the end of the file rather than replacing previous contents.</p>
         
         </div>
      
      
      <div>
         
         <h2>Input Ports</h2>
         
         <p>fileName - the name or path of a file. If this is a filename or a relative path, it is interpreted relative to the home directory.</p>
         
         <p>dataIn - if connected, supplies data to be written to the file.</p>
         
         </div>
      
      
      <div>
         
         <h2>Output Ports</h2>
         
         <p> fileReference - the absolute path to the file represented by this node.</p>
         
         <p> dataOut - if connected, the contents of the file will be read and sent out through this port.</p>
         
         </div>
      
      
      <div>
         
         <h2>Notes</h2>
         
         <p>If the filename is specified using both the property and the input port, the value from the input port takes precedence. </p>
         
		 <p>You'll rarely if ever use all the ports of a given file node; typically only one or two are connected.</p>
