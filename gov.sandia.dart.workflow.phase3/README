This is the Next Generation Workflow Engine. It is extremely important
that this plugin have NO external dependencies, including Eclipse dependencies.
The Ant file build.xml builds and installs the standalone workflow system, and it
must be able to operate solely on the contents of this project. That said, this
is packaged as an Eclipse plugin so the engine can be embedded in an RCP app.

There are some configuration files in “resources” that you will need to populate
to make the networking components function.
