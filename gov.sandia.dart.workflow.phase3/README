This is the Next Generation Workflow runtime. This version is implemented on
Sarasvati. It is extremely important that this plugin have NO external dependencies,
including Eclipse dependencies. The Ant file build.xml builds and installs the
standalone workflow system, and it must be able to operate solely on the contents
of this project. That said, this is packaged as an Eclipse plugin so the engine
can be embedded in an RCP app.

If you're not at Sandia, there are some configuration files in “resources” that
you will need to modify to make the networking components function.
