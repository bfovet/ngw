George's description of his task:

- Define dependencies and all upstream and downstream artifacts in an analysis workflow component.  Provide the option to define the following:
- Input parameters the component will consume
- Response parameters that the component is expected to produce
- Set of static files that the component will consume.  These files are the same for each component instance.  Examples: Sierra input file, Cubit journal file
- Set of upstream instance files that the component will consume.  These files are different for each component instance.  Examples: results file, history file, heartbeat file
- Set of downstream instance files the component is expected to produce.  Examples: genesis file from a Cubit component, video file from an Ensight component
If any of the expected output artifacts (parameters or files) is not produced execute failure action.  Default action: kill other executing workflow component instances for the current workflow instance and terminate workflow instance.  Optional action: invoke user defined random failure detection logic.  If random failure is reported re-execute the workflow component instance (user needs a mechanism to define the maximum allowed number of allowed retries)
